1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,958
Fushi leads a life of peace,

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:10,083
living together with Gugu and the others.

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,583
Little by little, the stimulants built up.

4
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:17,792
The accumulated stimuli and a fight with Gugu

5
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,708
lead Fushi to take Pioran's advice

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,833
to look for Gugu, who had run away.

7
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,958
The two of them are reunited once again.

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,875
TO YOUR ETERNITY

9
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,333
I heard it's over here.

10
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,958
So this is where the monster lives?

11
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,417
But nobody's here.

12
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,250
Scary...

13
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,417
-It appeared!
-Monster!

14
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,125
We did it, Fushi!

15
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:30,667
The greater the stimulus,
the deeper it is imprinted in one's memory.

16
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,667
For example, encountering a monster...

17
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,125
One boy became friends with a monster.

18
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,083
Did you see them?

19
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,542
Their faces were hilarious!

20
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:53,708
Gugu.

21
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,000
Not going back? To Grandpa Beer's place.

22
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,292
No.

23
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,958
Didn't you hear?

24
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,792
Grandpa Beer stuffed alcohol inside of me.

25
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,417
Gugu!

26
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:19,958
What... I... can't... move...

27
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,000
EPISODE 9: DEEP MEMORY

28
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,417
I haven't eaten anything in so long...

29
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,333
Fushi, do you have anything?

30
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,000
No...

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,542
I see...

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,833
I made it!

33
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,417
Gugu, I made it!

34
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,417
Hold on. I'll make more!

35
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,042
Got it! Eat up!

36
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,917
This is great!

37
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,250
You can even make food now?

38
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,042
The greater the stimulus was,

39
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,625
the easier it was for Fushi to replicate it.

40
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,792
-The greater the stimulus, 
the deeper it is imprinted in one's memory.
-Amazing. Anything else?

41
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,375
-That's all.
-Oh, I see.

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:25,375
Yet, depending on his future growth,

43
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,750
the day may come when Fushi is able

44
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,375
to replicate

45
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,292
-even the smallest of stimuli.
-Ah, I can't eat anymore...

46
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:42,333
Joan?

47
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:46,000
Myrr! Did you run away from home again?

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,958
Joan.

49
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,792
No, Fushi. This is Myrr.

50
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:52,042
This is Rynn's dog.

51
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,250
Who is Joan anyway?

52
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,958
Joan...

53
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,958
A person said that name when they saw my face.

54
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,792
Then Joan must have been your name.

55
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:06,375
Was it your parent who called you that?

56
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,042
I don't know.

57
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,583
But that person was my first person.

58
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,042
They became hollow, unable to move,

59
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,667
and I became them.

60
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,875
I see...

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,250
So your appearance
originally came from another person.

62
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,042
And that person died.

63
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,333
Died?

64
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,042
Yes. It means they passed away.

65
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,750
You can turn into a little girl, can't you?

66
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,083
Did she die too?

67
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,583
That huge bear and the wolf as well?

68
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,000
What is "death"?

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,917
It's the hollowness you spoke of.

70
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,375
But once it happens, you can never turn back.

71
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,833
That's death.

72
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:58,875
You were reacting to pain
when you created things, right?

73
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,917
Would you react to emotional pain as well?

74
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:04,000
For instance,

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,292
if I died and you were emotionally hurt,
you would be able to become me.

76
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,167
Something like that, right?

77
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:11,417
I think.

78
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,167
That's great, though. It's really great!

79
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,583
Why?

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,375
Even if I die,

81
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,500
at least you'll continue to think of me, right?

82
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,542
Yes.

83
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,125
You know, I'm all alone.

84
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,333
If I had grown up in a normal household...

85
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,042
There would be someone
who would prepare food for me every day.

86
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:35,042
I would have a bed to sleep in every night.

87
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:38,833
A mother to nurse me when I get sick.

88
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,292
A father asking me how I was doing every day.

89
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:46,708
Older twin sisters who would tease 
but play with me.

90
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,458
A big brother who would teach me lots of things.

91
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,292
To live a life where people would remember me.

92
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:56,583
It'd be a matter of course.

93
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,042
But... But then...

94
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:02,500
One day, I would feel that discomfort.

95
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,083
Come, children!

96
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:07,000
We received some cake. Let's eat it together.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,583
Yay! You didn't forget our promise!

98
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:13,542
Cherry cake, right? My favorite!

99
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,125
Wait, Gugu.

100
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,458
Wait.

101
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:19,875
Such are the rules.

102
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,042
Hm? Why are both of you waiting over there?

103
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,042
Come quickly and have some cake with us!

104
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,333
Yes. Thank you very much!

105
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,875
After a while, we had to move far away

106
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,958
due to my father's work.

107
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:40,750
But they didn't take us with them.

108
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,833
Well, I guess it's just the two of us now.

109
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,583
All right. Let's go find work elsewhere.

110
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,125
I thought they were my family,

111
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,583
but they were just my employers.

112
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:58,417
The only one who actually
thought of me was my brother.

113
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,958
Ever since we became alone,
he has always been kind to me.

114
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,917
But now, even that is in the past.

115
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,833
In the end, I'm alone.

116
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,042
But now you're here.

117
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,292
I'm sorry for what I did, Fushi...

118
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,625
I'm sorry for hurting you.

119
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,542
If I die, become me, Fushi.

120
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,250
I'm a bit sleepy now...

121
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,000
Did you eat too much?

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,208
Right now, I'm really happy.

123
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,292
After all, you're worrying about me.

124
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:42,083
You thought of me, and now you're here for me.

125
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,958
I feel like...

126
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,250
that's what family should be.

127
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,000
Gugu...

128
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:16,250
Found you! What are you doing here?

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,125
Rynn?

130
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,375
I spent so much time looking for you!

131
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,292
How did you find us?

132
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,167
I heard Myrr.

133
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:27,208
Myrr likes to run away too much.

134
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,000
Why won't you come back?

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,333
What are you saying, "why won't I come back"?

136
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,208
I am a victim here!

137
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,333
The old man said he repented.

138
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,083
And he'll take out the thing inside for free!

139
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,625
For free?

140
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,125
Obviously!

141
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,958
So we should go back.

142
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,125
Come on, let's go.

143
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,375
Wait!

144
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:01,042
Why does everyone want me back?

145
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,500
Why?

146
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,292
Because we all need you.

147
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,792
Because we love you!

148
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,833
Really?

149
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,375
Even you?

150
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,875
Yes.

151
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,167
Grandpa, Grandma, food is ready!

152
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,208
-Bleh! 
-Yuck!

153
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,792
If you're going to complain, make it yourself!

154
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,667
Nah.

155
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,042
Too lazy.

156
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,958
I don't want to do this either!

157
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,708
But I won't go back.

158
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,792
I threw away the mask.

159
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:42,208
That means I threw away my humanity as well.

160
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,083
Wasn't that supposed 
to be a gag for the customers?

161
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:49,167
Sorry, I lied.

162
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,125
It was to hide the scars on my face.

163
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,958
I'm so sorry... And you're still hiding it?

164
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,625
What are you doing?

165
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,417
Horrible! Pervert! Evil!

166
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:08,333
Why are you sticking to the tree
like some sort of bug?

167
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,000
Who cares about your face?

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It matters to me!

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,167
I don't want it to be seen!

170
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,208
By you...

171
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:20,083
Even though you were showing it off before?

172
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,000
Fushi, please be quiet for a bit!

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,917
What? So you just won't show it to me?

174
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, that's not really...

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,792
Then if you have a mask,
will you stop acting like a bug?

176
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,667
I'll go get it. So tell me where you left it.

177
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,500
Oh, where could I have left it...

178
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,458
Gugu.

179
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,917
What?

180
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,083
You always look like your heart hurts

181
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,833
when you talk to Rynn.

182
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,042
Will you feel better with the mask?

183
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,042
Wh... What...

184
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,208
What are you saying?

185
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,292
I'll go find it!

186
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:04,292
Don't leave me behind!

187
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,083
What a weird guy.

188
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,417
But he's so nice.

189
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,625
Hey, should I show you my wound?

190
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,875
My wound is pretty bad.

191
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:27,542
Maybe you'll realize your wound
isn't bad enough for you to hide it.

192
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,042
W... Wait!

193
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,125
See? Isn't it horrible?

194
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,083
Of course not!

195
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,292
Wha...

196
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:45,375
That's so mean! I was so worried about it!

197
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,542
Compared to my injury,
that looks like a scratch!

198
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:52,208
-Then show me your injury!
-No! No!

199
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:56,750
I can well affirm that your wound
is nearly completely healed.

200
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,042
So why are you worried about it? Stupid!

201
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:03,083
There's a limit to over-reacting!

202
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,667
What...

203
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,292
You say the same things my parents do...

204
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,292
Oh... I'm sorry...

205
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,250
Is it not going well with your parents?

206
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,667
It doesn't matter what my life is like.

207
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,375
Because I'd be over-reacting.

208
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,708
Well... That's... Don't cry...

209
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:29,208
Fushi, come back quick...

210
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,958
They treat me like some kind of pet.

211
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,542
They always want things to go their way.

212
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,292
It's so mean!

213
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:41,000
My favorite color is purple,

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,333
but they always buy me green stuff
because it's the family color!

215
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,083
Isn't green fine?

216
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,083
That's not all.

217
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:53,042
One time I painted a picture,
and my mother hired an art teacher.

218
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,250
I didn't like that, so I started sewing.

219
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,208
And she hired a sewing teacher.

220
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,917
I just want to do things freely...

221
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:05,958
There were always people surrounding me.

222
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,792
If I sneezed, 
they would come to check my temperature.

223
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,808
They'd make me eat food every day
even when I didn't want to.

224
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,708
They'd comb my hair four times a day.

225
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,208
Whenever I went outside
to escape that stifling house,

226
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,250
an attendant would follow.

227
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,708
I've never had any time to be alone!

228
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:34,000
As if I haven't been recognized
as an individual at all in that house.

229
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,250
That's dumb. 
You have some nice parents, don't you?

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,833
You're the one that's spoiled.

231
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,083
You must have it tough.

232
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:45,917
So tough that you need to chalk up
others' consideration for you as misfortune

233
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,958
so you can gloat about how unlucky you are.

234
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,667
Don't misunderstand!

235
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:53,750
I wouldn't expect you to understand my values!

236
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,250
Even this wound!

237
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,958
I only got it 
because I was born into that house!

238
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,042
What?

239
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,500
Someone pushed me from behind.

240
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,125
They said it might have been someone
who has a grudge against my father.

241
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:12,042
And they wouldn't worry about me at all!

242
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,333
You're wrong.

243
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,542
What? Did you say I was wrong?

244
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:24,667
No. I said that you were stupid.

245
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,333
Hey! How many times 
are you going to call me stupid in one day?

246
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:51,417
Hey, Myrr, did I say anything bad?

247
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,167
No, woof!

248
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,875
Hey, how did you get an injury on your face?

249
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,125
I won't tell you.

250
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,917
If I tell you, you'll hate me.

251
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,625
What do you mean?

252
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,750
Do you like me?

253
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,708
I won't tell you.

254
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,792
If I tell you, you'll hate me.

255
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,233
You won't tell me anything.

256
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:22,667
I'm a monster. That's all you need to know.

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,625
Um... Hey! I brought this mask
as a present for you!

258
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,750
Grandpa said 
this was a legendary folk mask or something!

259
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,250
Sounds amazing, right?

260
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,833
Use it if you'd like.

261
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,292
I don't need something like this!

262
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:54,042
You're pretty stupid too.

263
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:04,042
I don't care whether 
you're a human or a monster.

264
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:06,583
You know, either way, you're you, aren't you?

265
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,625
Whether you expose everything

266
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,875
or hide everything,

267
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,208
it's weird either way. But I like it.

268
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,000
That's you.

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,792
You're only you.

270
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,708
So come out.

271
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,708
Do you intend never to look me in the eyes?

272
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:28,750
I want to get to know you better.

273
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,917
Even if you need to wear a mask
all the way through.

274
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:38,167
You know... The wind is nice today.

275
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,917
Fushi's late, isn't he?

276
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,208
Should we wait? Should we find him?

277
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,292
Let's go.

278
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,250
Sorry for before. I said some mean things.

279
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,625
I don't recall.

280
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,875
Found it!

281
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,750
Is it fun pretending to be human?

282
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:30,542
Your enemies are always waiting for an opening.

283
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,500
Be careful.

284
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,333
I tossed away the mask just ahead,

285
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,833
so Fushi should be there.

286
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,750
Are you sure we won't miss each other?

287
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,542
Don't worry. He'll find us.

288
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,000
How do you know?

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,667
Well, because he's like that.

290
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,583
What? I don't get it.

291
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,875
Let's go back, Ms. Rynn.

292
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,917
No! Let go!

293
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,500
Who is that?

294
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,625
Some rascal being paid to abduct me!

295
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:06,375
How much did they offer for capturing me?

296
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,292
Oh, the Cropp girl.

297
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,375
-She ran away again?
-Let me go!

298
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,083
Let go of me!

299
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:16,275
No!

300
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,958
Run!

301
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,750
Did you run away from home?

302
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,458
Yes, that's right.

303
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,458
My father probably hired 20 or so guys

304
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:45,125
to run around the streets and find me.

305
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,917
Why did you run away?

306
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,500
Tell me the reason.

307
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Hm? Haven't I already?

308
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,750
You mean what we spoke about earlier?

309
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,958
Yes. Something wrong with that?

310
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,958
No...

311
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,292
So was this mask 
to prevent them from finding you?

312
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,042
Yes.

313
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:08,250
I didn't want to be dragged back
before finding you guys.

314
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,500
Sorry for making up the story 
about it being a present.

315
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,792
Are you disappointed?

316
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,542
I'll return it.

317
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,250
Thanks for lending me the mask.

318
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,292
I think I understand you a bit more.

319
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:39,750
Don't worry. I won't look.

320
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,333
It doesn't really...

321
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,583
Thanks.

322
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,833
I found it!

323
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,875
Fushi!

324
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,667
All right. 
Let's head back to Grandpa Beer's place.

325
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:07,917
Really? You just said you didn't want to.

326
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:11,292
Isn't that the best place for you to be?

327
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:16,167
Yes, but... Aren't you angry about what he did?

328
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,250
I don't really care anymore.

329
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,500
It's not like I've forgiven

330
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,750
what was done to me,

331
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,833
or that I don't think it was wrong.

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I just no longer care about

333
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,667
my own circumstances.

334
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,792
That's all.

335
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,750
That's why I can go back.

336
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's go.

337
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,000
My lady!

338
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,917
Where did you run off to?

339
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,958
Don't try to fool us with this mask!

340
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,250
Come, let's go back.

341
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,125
Your father is worried.

342
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,042
Might you have the wrong person?

343
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,000
I haven't heard of a "Rynn".

344
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,583
As cute as always.

345
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,292
But I never said anything about "Rynn".

346
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,375
Please stop this, my lady.

347
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,750
I don't want to... It's such a pain...

348
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,750
Just ignore them!

349
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:31,583
My lady! My lady!

350
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,792
She's coming!

351
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,625
It'll be troublesome if she chases us back.

352
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,208
Fushi! Please!

353
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,750
Wait!

354
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,042
My lady...

355
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,000
What? Who is this child?

356
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,250
Oh, no! What should I do?

357
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,583
Hurts...

358
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,917
-She's bleeding! This is bad!
-Hurts...

359
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,500
There! The house is right ahead!

360
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,292
Where's Fushi?

361
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,233
Don't worry. He'll come in a bit!

362
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,500
I wonder.

363
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,292
Will he really?

364
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,875
I doubt he will return.

365
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,042
For two reasons.

366
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:15,583
First,

367
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,333
he has acquired nothing useful

368
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:20,750
since his last battle.

369
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,208
Second,

370
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,792
the first to strike wins.

371
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,792
What was that cry?

372
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,250
Fushi is doing it flashily...

373
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,625
Someone help!

374
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,917
A monster!

375
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,292
-A monster? 
-I'll go take a look!

376
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,042
-Go back to the house!
-Wait!

377
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:45,375
Don't leave me...

378
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,542
I said... I can go back alone.

379
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,917
All right. Be careful!

380
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,083
Okay... You too!

381
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,042
Fushi!

382
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,542
What? Blood?

383
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,375
Fushi!

384
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,125
Fushi! Fushi! Fushi!

385
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,208
What is this?

386
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,542
The unknown enemy

387
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:35,958
makes a reappearance.

388
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:41,125
Fushi was attacked in the forest.

389
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,500
Gugu rushes to save him.

390
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,000
A bond between brothers

391
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,458
was formed in the moment of resurrection.

392
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
